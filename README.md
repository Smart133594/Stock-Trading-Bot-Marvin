# Stock-Trading-Bot
A stock trading bot coded on QuantConnect using python

The bot's name is Marvin

Marvin is a fully deployable to broker bot that can trade real money. Algorithm is based on the RSI, exponential moving averages, and momentum. If Marvin is still holding any stocks at 3:50 pm (E.T.), it will sell everything since the market closes at 4 pm (E.T.) and it would otherwise have to hold overnight.

NOTICE: this code is meant to run on QuantConnect.com and attached to a trading broker such as Alpaca. It's here only for show and will not function properly if run in a normal IDE.
